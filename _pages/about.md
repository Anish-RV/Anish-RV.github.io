I am a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Political Economy. Through my coursework, personal projects and involvement in student organizations, I have gained significant experience in backend, test-driven programming. Some of the projects that I have worked on include creating a local version of Git from scratch, coding the back end of a web mapping application and so on. I am also involved in student organizations at Berkeley like Berkeley Model United Nations, where I work on internal projects within the Tech staff, and Political Computer Science, where I collaborate with several team members working on projects like a web app that informs users about the bills their political representatives have voted on.

Outside of Computer Science, I spend my time reading Stephen King novels, playing and refereeing soccer, watching old Telugu movies and reading way too much news.
