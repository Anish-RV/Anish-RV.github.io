I am a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Political Economy. Through my coursework, personal projects and involvement in student organizations, I have gained significant experience in backend, test-driven programming. Some of the projects that I have worked on include creating a local version of Git from scratch, coding the back end of a web mapping application and so on. I am also involved in tech organizations at Berkeley like the Technology staff of Berkeley Model United Nations and Political Computer Science, where I collaborate with several team members working on projects like a web app that informs users about the bills their political representatives have voted on.
